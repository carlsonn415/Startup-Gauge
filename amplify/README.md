# Amplify Notes

This project targets AWS Amplify Hosting for SSR Next.js.

- Connect the GitHub repo in Amplify console
- Add environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- (Later) Add Amplify Auth (Cognito) and Functions via Amplify Gen 2

Build settings can be managed in the console or with `amplify.yml` if needed.
